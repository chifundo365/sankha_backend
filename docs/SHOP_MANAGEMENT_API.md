# Shop Management APIs - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Completed: November 19, 2025

### Overview
Built complete CRUD operations for Shop Management with ownership validation, role-based authorization, and comprehensive filtering capabilities.

---

## 📋 Features Implemented

### 1. **Validation Schemas** (`src/schemas/shop.schema.ts`)
- ✅ `createShopSchema` - Validate shop creation
- ✅ `updateShopSchema` - Validate shop updates (at least one field required)
- ✅ `getShopSchema` - UUID validation
- ✅ `deleteShopSchema` - UUID validation
- ✅ `listShopsSchema` - Pagination, filtering, search
- ✅ `verifyShopSchema` - Admin-only verification

### 2. **Controller** (`src/controllers/shop.controller.ts`)

#### Public Endpoints:
- ✅ `getAllShops()` - List shops with pagination, filters (city, verified, delivery, search, owner)
- ✅ `getShopById()` - Get single shop with owner details and counts

#### Protected Endpoints:
- ✅ `createShop()` - Create shop (SELLER: max 1 shop, ADMIN: unlimited)
- ✅ `updateShop()` - Update shop (owner or admin)
- ✅ `deleteShop()` - Delete shop (prevents deletion if products/orders exist)
- ✅ `verifyShop()` - Verify/unverify shop (ADMIN only)
- ✅ `getMyShops()` - Get current user's shops

#### Security Features:
- ✅ **Ownership Validation**: Sellers can only manage their own shops
- ✅ **Admin Override**: ADMIN/SUPER_ADMIN can manage any shop
- ✅ **Seller Limit**: Each SELLER can only own ONE shop
- ✅ **Auto-Verification**: ADMIN-created shops are auto-verified
- ✅ **Safe Deletion**: Prevents deletion if shop has products or orders

### 3. **Routes** (`src/routes/shop.routes.ts`)

```

## 🎯 Business Rules

### Seller Limitations:
- ✅ Each SELLER can only own **ONE shop**
- ✅ Must verify ownership before updating/deleting
- ✅ New shops start as **unverified** (is_verified = false)
- ✅ Can view only their own shops via `/my-shops`

### Admin Privileges:
- ✅ Can create **unlimited shops**
- ✅ Auto-verified upon creation (is_verified = true)
- ✅ Can manage **any shop** (update, delete, verify)
- ✅ Can verify/unverify any shop via `/verify` endpoint

### Shop Deletion Protection:
- ✅ Cannot delete if `shop_products > 0`
- ✅ Cannot delete if `orders > 0`
- ✅ Must clean up products/orders before deletion

### Data Integrity:
- ✅ `owner_id` automatically set to current user
- ✅ Latitude: -90 to 90
- ✅ Longitude: -180 to 180
- ✅ Phone: 10-20 characters
- ✅ Email: Valid format
- ✅ All optional fields can be null
